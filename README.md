# Endometriosis
Evaluating the risk of endometriosis based on patients’ self-assessment questionnaires

## Functions
To train models specified in the publication, custom functions define in lib were used.

## Notebooks
As using third-party data prevents us to publish reusable version of the script (we cannot share the data), we shared the notebooks with printed results and visualizations of the experiments.
All results are in the notebook "Evaluating the risk of endometriosis based on patients’ self-assessment questioners.ipynb"
To analyze basic statistics and models described in the publication, go to "Metrics" tab.
To see the feature selection, see "Feature Selection" tab.
Each model is described in "Comparison of subsets" tab.
